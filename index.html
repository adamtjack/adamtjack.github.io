                    Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire.

                    She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet.
